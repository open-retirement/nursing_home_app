### Nursing Home Comparison Web Application

Purpose is to provide information about nearby nursing homes so that users can determine which is the best
option.

This is a node.js application using express and jade templating
My working version of node is v0.10.26 which is a little old, but it should work no problem with newer node versions

*Start command with debug is*

```
DEBUG=nursing_home_app npm start
```
